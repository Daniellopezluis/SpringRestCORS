# SpringRestCORS

First try of solving a challenge imposed by [Epic Labs](http://www.epiclabs.io/) team in order to asses my fitness for a web development role.

The challenge consisted on creating a mock-up page of their previous web page, using Spring MVC alongside HTML, CSS and jQuery.

This was my first time having contact with such technologies. After the challenge, I was able to move forward with the next step of the process :).
